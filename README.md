# Sudoku Sharp
A code exercise to create a Sudoku Solver using .NET

A Sudoku puzzle is grid a grid of 9 by 9 grid filled with the numbers 1 to 9. Each number should be used exactly once in each row, column and 3 by 3 group. To start a Sudoku puzzle has numbers in some boxes such that there is exactly one solution to the puzzle.

Depending on the starting numbers a sudoku puzzle can be graded from easy to difficult, or tofu to sumo.

# This exercise
This .NET project contains a simple WPF App that displays a Sudoku. There are two buttons; new and solve. You need to implement the solve function and you may want to make new display more than one Sudoku puzzle.

# Possible next steps

* Implement a check method that checks to see if a Sudoku solution is correct.
* Implement a solve method that takes a starter sudoku and solves it.
